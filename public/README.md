This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Precondition
The Teko ID Service should have a public client with ID: `public_client`, redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000` and at least `openid profile` scopes.

# Run the app
In the project directory, run:
`yarn start`

The application will auto popup at `http://localhost:3000`.
